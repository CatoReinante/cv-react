      <h1>Joaquin Reinante - Full Stack Developer / Lic. Administracion</h1>
      <p>
        I graduated as a Business Administration professional, but not long ago
        I discovered that my true passion lies in web development. Thatâ€™s why I
        made the leap and enrolled in an intensive 3-month, 700+ hour Full Stack
        Development bootcamp, where I learned to build complete applications
        from scratch using HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js,
        Express, MongoDB, and MySQL. Through countless projects, challenges, and
        teamwork, I developed not only strong technical skills but also the
        ability to learn quickly, adapt, and solve problems under pressure. I
        feel fully prepared to face new challenges, keep growing, and contribute
        with both dedication and creativity.
